# This example is from the man page of zic(8) with the following adjustments:
# * Link line was commented out because we don't support it yet
# * Fractional second was commented out because we don't support it yet
# * Zone name changed from Europe/Zurich to Zurich so that the resulting file structure works with our test harness
#   which expects a flat structure.
