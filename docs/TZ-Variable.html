<span id="Specifying-the-Time-Zone-with-TZ"></span><h4 class="subsection">21.5.6 Specifying the Time Zone with <code>TZ</code></h4>

<p>In POSIX systems, a user can specify the time zone by means of the
<code>TZ</code> environment variable.  For information about how to set
environment variables, see <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Environment-Variables.html">Environment Variables</a>.  The functions
for accessing the time zone are declared in <samp>time.h</samp>.
<span id="index-time_002eh-3"></span>
<span id="index-time-zone"></span>
</p>
<p>You should not normally need to set <code>TZ</code>.  If the system is
configured properly, the default time zone will be correct.  You might
set <code>TZ</code> if you are using a computer over a network from a
different time zone, and would like times reported to you in the time
zone local to you, rather than what is local to the computer.
</p>
<p>In POSIX.1 systems the value of the <code>TZ</code> variable can be in one of
three formats.  With the GNU C Library, the most common format is the
last one, which can specify a selection from a large database of time
zone information for many regions of the world.  The first two formats
are used to describe the time zone information directly, which is both
more cumbersome and less precise.  But the POSIX.1 standard only
specifies the details of the first two formats, so it is good to be
familiar with them in case you come across a POSIX.1 system that doesn’t
support a time zone information database.
</p>
<p>The first format is used when there is no Daylight Saving Time (or
summer time) in the local time zone:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example"><span class="roman"><var>std</var> <var>offset</var></span>
</pre></div>

<p>The <var>std</var> string specifies the time zone abbreviation.  It must be
three or more characters long and must not contain a leading colon,
embedded digits, commas, nor plus and minus signs.  There is no space
character separating the time zone abbreviation from the <var>offset</var>, so these
restrictions are necessary to parse the specification correctly.
</p>
<p>The <var>offset</var> specifies the time value you must add to the local time
to get a Coordinated Universal Time value.  It has syntax like
[<code>+</code>|<code>-</code>]<var>hh</var>[<code>:</code><var>mm</var>[<code>:</code><var>ss</var>]].  This
is positive if the local time zone is west of the Prime Meridian and
negative if it is east.  The hour must be between <code>0</code> and
<code>24</code>, and the minute and seconds between <code>0</code> and <code>59</code>.
</p>
<p>For example, here is how we would specify Eastern Standard Time, but
without any Daylight Saving Time alternative:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">EST+5
</pre></div>

<p>The second format is used when there is Daylight Saving Time:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example"><span class="roman"><var>std</var> <var>offset</var> <var>dst</var> [<var>offset</var>]<code>,</code><var>start</var>[<code>/</code><var>time</var>]<code>,</code><var>end</var>[<code>/</code><var>time</var>]</span>
</pre></div>

<p>The initial <var>std</var> and <var>offset</var> specify the standard time zone, as
described above.  The <var>dst</var> string and <var>offset</var> are the abbreviation
and offset for the corresponding Daylight Saving Time zone; if the
<var>offset</var> is omitted, it defaults to one hour ahead of standard time.
</p>
<p>The remainder of the specification describes when Daylight Saving Time is
in effect.  The <var>start</var> field is when Daylight Saving Time goes into
effect and the <var>end</var> field is when the change is made back to standard
time.  The following formats are recognized for these fields:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><span><code>J<var>n</var></code></span></dt>
<dd><p>This specifies the Julian day, with <var>n</var> between <code>1</code> and <code>365</code>.
February 29 is never counted, even in leap years.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><code><var>n</var></code></span></dt>
<dd><p>This specifies the Julian day, with <var>n</var> between <code>0</code> and <code>365</code>.
February 29 is counted in leap years.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><code>M<var>m</var>.<var>w</var>.<var>d</var></code></span></dt>
<dd><p>This specifies day <var>d</var> of week <var>w</var> of month <var>m</var>.  The day
<var>d</var> must be between <code>0</code> (Sunday) and <code>6</code>.  The week
<var>w</var> must be between <code>1</code> and <code>5</code>; week <code>1</code> is the
first week in which day <var>d</var> occurs, and week <code>5</code> specifies the
<em>last</em> <var>d</var> day in the month.  The month <var>m</var> should be
between <code>1</code> and <code>12</code>.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>The <var>time</var> fields specify when, in the local time currently in
effect, the change to the other time occurs.  If omitted, the default is
<code>02:00:00</code>.  The hours part of the time fields can range from
-167 through 167; this is an extension to POSIX.1, which allows
only the range 0 through 24.
</p>
<p>Here are some example <code>TZ</code> values, including the appropriate
Daylight Saving Time and its dates of applicability.  In North
American Eastern Standard Time (EST) and Eastern Daylight Time (EDT),
the normal offset from UTC is 5 hours; since this is
west of the prime meridian, the sign is positive.  Summer time begins on
March’s second Sunday at 2:00am, and ends on November’s first Sunday
at 2:00am.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">EST+5EDT,M3.2.0/2,M11.1.0/2
</pre></div>

<p>Israel Standard Time (IST) and Israel Daylight Time (IDT) are 2 hours
ahead of the prime meridian in winter, springing forward an hour on
March’s fourth Thursday at 26:00 (i.e., 02:00 on the first Friday on or
after March 23), and falling back on October’s last Sunday at 02:00.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">IST-2IDT,M3.4.4/26,M10.5.0
</pre></div>

<p>Western Argentina Summer Time (WARST) is 3 hours behind the prime
meridian all year.  There is a dummy fall-back transition on December
31 at 25:00 daylight saving time (i.e., 24:00 standard time,
equivalent to January 1 at 00:00 standard time), and a simultaneous
spring-forward transition on January 1 at 00:00 standard time, so
daylight saving time is in effect all year and the initial <code>WART</code>
is a placeholder.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">WART4WARST,J1/0,J365/25
</pre></div>

<p>Western Greenland Time (WGT) and Western Greenland Summer Time (WGST)
are 3 hours behind UTC in the winter.  Its clocks follow the European
Union rules of springing forward by one hour on March’s last Sunday at
01:00 UTC (-02:00 local time) and falling back on October’s
last Sunday at 01:00 UTC (-01:00 local time).
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">WGT3WGST,M3.5.0/-2,M10.5.0/-1
</pre></div>

<p>The schedule of Daylight Saving Time in any particular jurisdiction has
changed over the years.  To be strictly correct, the conversion of dates
and times in the past should be based on the schedule that was in effect
then.  However, this format has no facilities to let you specify how the
schedule has changed from year to year.  The most you can do is specify
one particular schedule—usually the present day schedule—and this is
used to convert any date, no matter when.  For precise time zone
specifications, it is best to use the time zone information database
(see below).
</p>
<p>The third format looks like this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">:<var>characters</var>
</pre></div>

<p>Each operating system interprets this format differently; in
the GNU C Library, <var>characters</var> is the name of a file which describes the time
zone.
</p>
<span id="index-_002fetc_002flocaltime"></span>
<span id="index-localtime-1"></span>
<p>If the <code>TZ</code> environment variable does not have a value, the
operation chooses a time zone by default.  In the GNU C Library, the
default time zone is like the specification ‘<samp>TZ=:/etc/localtime</samp>’
(or ‘<samp>TZ=:/usr/local/etc/localtime</samp>’, depending on how the GNU C Library
was configured; see <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Installation.html">Installing the GNU C Library</a>).  Other C libraries use their own
rule for choosing the default time zone, so there is little we can say
about them.
</p>
<span id="index-time-zone-database"></span>
<span id="index-_002fusr_002fshare_002fzoneinfo"></span>
<span id="index-zoneinfo"></span>
<p>If <var>characters</var> begins with a slash, it is an absolute file name;
otherwise the library looks for the file
<samp>/usr/share/zoneinfo/<var>characters</var></samp><!-- /@w -->.  The <samp>zoneinfo</samp>
directory contains data files describing local time zones in many
different parts of the world.  The names represent major cities, with
subdirectories for geographical areas; for example,
<samp>America/New_York</samp>, <samp>Europe/London</samp>, <samp>Asia/Hong_Kong</samp>.
These data files are installed by the system administrator, who also
sets <samp>/etc/localtime</samp> to point to the data file for the local time
zone.  The files typically come from the <a href="http://www.iana.org/time-zones">Time Zone Database</a> of time zone and daylight saving time
information for most regions of the world, which is maintained by a
community of volunteers and put in the public domain.
